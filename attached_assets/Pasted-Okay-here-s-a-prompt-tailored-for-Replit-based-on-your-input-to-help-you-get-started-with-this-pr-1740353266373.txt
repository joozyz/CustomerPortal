**Replit Prompt**

**Title:** Secure Cloud Service Management Platform

**Description:**

Build a comprehensive cloud service management platform with a customer-facing portal and a secure admin backend.  This platform will allow customers to manage a variety of services, including web hosting, mail hosting, domain management, and backups.

**Features:**

* **Customer Portal:**
    * User registration/login (with 2FA and rate limiting).
    * Service catalog and ordering.
    * Service management dashboard (overview, billing, support, etc.).
    * Domain management.
    * Spam filter settings.
* **Admin Backend:**
    * Secure admin dashboard (`/dashboard`).
    * Linux node management.
    * Service configuration and management.
    * Branding customization.
    * Interactive quizzes/guides for service configuration.
    * Monitoring and logging (consider integration with external SIEM if possible).
    * Resource usage and billing integration (Exoscale or similar).
    * SMTP configuration.
    * API integrations (Stripe, domain provider, mail server, spam filter provider).
    * Domain and mailbox management.
    * Spam filter management.
* **Security:**
    * Implement security best practices (NIST and PCI-DSS compliance where applicable).
    * Data encryption at rest.
    * WAF for web attack protection.
    * Secure API design.

**Technology Stack:**

* Python (FastAPI)
* SQLAlchemy
* Podman SDK
* Stripe API
* PostgreSQL
* Node.js/Nginx
* Podman and Podman Compose
* React or Vue.js
* Tailwind CSS

**Instructions:**

1.  Set up the project structure with separate folders for the frontend, backend, and database.
2.  Implement user authentication and authorization for both the customer portal and admin backend.
3.  Develop the customer-facing portal with a user-friendly interface for managing services.
4.  Create the admin backend with tools for managing services, infrastructure, and customer data.
5.  Implement API integrations with Stripe, Exoscale (or a similar provider), a domain provider, a mail server, and a spam filter provider.
6.  Ensure that the platform is secure and complies with relevant security standards.
7.  Write comprehensive documentation for the API and the platform's features.

**Replit Specific Notes:**

* Consider using Replit's database features for PostgreSQL hosting.
* Utilize Replit's environment variables to manage sensitive API keys and secrets.
* Take advantage of Replit's deployment features to easily deploy and share your project.

**Challenges:**

* Implementing robust security measures.
* Integrating with multiple third-party APIs.
* Designing a scalable and maintainable architecture.
